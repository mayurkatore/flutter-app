# Unplug App - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
Unplug is a student-focused mobile disaddiction and digital wellness app built with Flutter 3.x. The app helps students reduce mobile/social media addiction through research-backed features.

## Completed Architecture Planning
We have completed the architectural planning for the Unplug app with the following documents:

1. **Project Setup Plan** (`project_setup_plan.md`) - Outlines the required changes to pubspec.yaml and folder structure
2. **App Architecture** (`app_architecture.md`) - Detailed folder structure and component design
3. **Development Plan** (`development_plan.md`) - Phased implementation approach
4. **Phase 1 Implementation** (`phase1_implementation.md`) - Detailed steps for foundation setup

## Key Technical Decisions

### State Management
- **Riverpod** as the primary state management solution
- Provider types:
  - `StateProvider` for simple state (theme mode)
  - `StateNotifierProvider` for complex state management
  - `FutureProvider` for async data loading

### Folder Structure
```

├── utils/                  # Helper functions
└── routes/                 # Navigation routes
```

### UI/UX Design
- Material 3 design principles
- Light and dark theme support
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Bottom navigation with 4 tabs:
  1. Dashboard
  2. Focus
  3. Challenges
  4. Journal

### Core Features
1. **Smart Usage Dashboard** - Track daily/weekly screen time per app
2. **Focus Mode** - Customizable app blocking during study/sleep hours
3. **Challenges** - 7-day or 21-day detox challenges with streak tracking
4. **Journal & Mindfulness Prompts** - Daily reflective questions and mood tracking

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Current Phase)
- [ ] Update project configuration (pubspec.yaml)
- [ ] Create scalable folder structure
- [ ] Set up Riverpod for state management
- [ ] Implement theme management (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Create main app structure with bottom navigation

### Phase 2: Core Features Implementation
- [ ] Dashboard Screen with mock data
- [ ] Focus Mode Screen
- [ ] Challenges Screen
- [ ] Journal Screen

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Goal setting functionality
- [ ] Educational hub
- [ ] Peer group challenges
- [ ] Notifications system

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing
- [ ] Animations and transitions
- [ ] Responsive design implementation
- [ ] Offline support
- [ ] Testing and bug fixes

## Next Steps

To implement the Unplug app, we need to switch to Code mode to:

1. Update the pubspec.yaml file with the required dependencies
2. Create the folder structure as planned
3. Implement the Riverpod providers
4. Set up theme management
5. Create the main application structure with bottom navigation

The architectural foundation has been established and documented. The next step is to begin the actual implementation of the codebase.
