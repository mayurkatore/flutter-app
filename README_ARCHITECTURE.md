### Core Features
1. **Smart Usage Dashboard** - Track daily/weekly screen time
2. **Focus Mode** - Customizable app blocking
3. **Challenges** - Streak tracking and badges
4. **Journal** - Mood tracking and reflections

### State Management
- Theme management with light/dark modes
- App usage data providers

- Journal entry management

## Implementation Status

✅ **Planning Phase Complete**
- All architectural decisions made
- Folder structure designed
- Data models defined
- Implementation roadmap established

▶️ **Ready for Implementation**
- Clear documentation for all components
- Implementation guidelines available
- Code structure examples provided

## Next Steps

The architecture phase is complete and the project is ready for implementation. To begin coding:

1. Switch to Code mode
2. Implement the folder structure
3. Set up Riverpod providers
4. Create theme management system
5. Implement main application structure
6. Begin building core feature screens

## Documentation Reference

All planning documents are available in the project root for reference during implementation:

- `project_setup_plan.md`
- `app_architecture.md`
- `development_plan.md`
- `phase1_implementation.md`
- `data_models.md`
- `architecture_diagram.md`
- `implementation_summary.md`
- `final_architecture_summary.md`

This comprehensive architectural foundation will guide the implementation of a scalable, maintainable Flutter application that meets all requirements for the Unplug digital wellness app.
