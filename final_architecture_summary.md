## Key Technical Decisions

### Framework & Language
- Flutter 3.x with Dart
- Material 3 design system
- Riverpod for state management

### Architecture Pattern
- Feature-first folder organization
- Separation of concerns (UI, business logic, data)
- Scalable structure for future enhancements

### State Management
- Riverpod as the primary state management solution
- Provider types based on use case complexity
- Immutable data patterns

### UI/UX Design
- Light and dark theme support
- Responsive layout for multiple device sizes
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Intuitive bottom navigation

### Data Management
- Local storage with SharedPreferences and SQLite
- Mock data for initial implementation
- Extensible models for future features

## Implementation Roadmap Summary

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed in Planning)

## Ready for Implementation

All architectural planning is complete and documented. The project is ready for the implementation phase with:

1. Clear folder structure guidelines
2. Defined data models
3. State management patterns
4. UI component organization
5. Implementation roadmap
6. Code structure examples

## Next Steps

To begin implementation, switch to Code mode to:

1. Update pubspec.yaml with required dependencies
2. Create the planned folder structure
3. Implement Riverpod providers
4. Set up theme management
5. Create main application structure
6. Begin implementing core feature screens

The architectural foundation is solid and will support a scalable, maintainable application that meets all the specified requirements for the Unplug digital wellness app.
