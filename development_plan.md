# Unplug App - Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step plan for implementing the Unplug mobile application, a student-focused digital wellness app designed to help reduce mobile/social media addiction.

## Implementation Approach
We'll follow an iterative approach, implementing core features first with mock data, then adding real functionality. The development will be divided into four phases:

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup
### Goals:
- Set up project structure
- Configure dependencies
- Implement basic theme and navigation

### Tasks:
1. Update pubspec.yaml with project name and dependencies
2. Create scalable folder structure
3. Set up Riverpod for state management
4. Implement theme management (light/dark mode)
5. Create main app structure with bottom navigation

### Estimated Time: 2-3 hours

## Phase 2: Core Features Implementation
### Goals:
- Implement all four main screens with mock data
- Create basic UI components
- Set up data models

### Tasks:
1. Dashboard Screen
   - Usage charts and statistics
   - App usage list
   - Red-zone alerts
   - Daily/weekly summaries

2. Focus Mode Screen
   - Timer functionality
   - App blocking controls
   - Preset configurations

3. Challenges Screen
   - Challenge listings
   - Streak tracking
   - Badge system

4. Journal Screen
   - Mood tracking
   - Journal entries
   - Prompts system

### Estimated Time: 8-10 hours

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
### Goals:
- Implement additional features
- Add real functionality to mock data
- Create service layers

### Tasks:
1. Goal Setting System
   - Goal creation and management
   - Progress tracking
   - Time saved calculations

2. Educational Hub
   - Infographics viewer
   - Quiz system
   - Resource library

3. Peer Group Challenges
   - Challenge creation
   - Group management
   - Progress sharing

4. Service Layer Implementation
   - Usage tracking service
   - Notification service
   - Storage service

### Estimated Time: 10-12 hours

## Phase 4: Polish & Testing
### Goals:
- Add animations and transitions
- Implement responsive design
- Add offline support
- Test and optimize

### Tasks:
1. Animations Implementation
   - Page transitions
   - Micro-interactions
   - Data visualizations

2. Responsive Design
   - Layout adjustments
   - Orientation handling
   - Tablet support

3. Offline Support
   - Local storage implementation
   - Data synchronization

4. Testing
   - Unit tests
   - Widget tests
   - Integration tests

5. Performance Optimization
   - Code optimization
   - Asset optimization
   - Memory management

### Estimated Time: 6-8 hours

## Total Estimated Development Time: 26-33 hours

## Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch for each major component
2. Implement with mock data first
3. Add unit tests for each component
4. Integrate with service layer
5. UI/UX refinement
6. Code review and optimization
7. Merge to main branch

## Quality Assurance
- Follow Flutter best practices
- Maintain consistent code style
- Write comprehensive comments
- Implement error handling
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Test on multiple device sizes
